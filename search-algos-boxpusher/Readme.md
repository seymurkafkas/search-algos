## Compilation

Before compiling, you can choose the algorithm to use by passing its name to the searchWithAlgorithm function in main(). By default, this is set to aStar.
To compile the project, use the following command:

g++ box-pusher.cpp -o box-pusher.out

## Running the Program

To run, use the following command:

./box-pusher.out [inputFilePath] [outputFileName]

If an incorrect inputFilePath is supplied as an argument, the program throws an exception and terminates.
